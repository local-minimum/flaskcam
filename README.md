# FlaskCamServer

The purpose here is to produce a flask server in python that will work as a webcam
controlling application.

## Road Map

1. `Util.Recording` Needs to be able to produce file names
2. Produce server API for requesting single images
3. Enable recording and sending contents
4. Use a cache of images?
5. Dream
6. I never follow these things anyhow
